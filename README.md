<h2>3- What's the number ?<h2>
This is a guessing game that the user plays with the program/computer. The program generates a random number using the random function. The user tries to guess it by inputting a value. The program then indicates whether the guess is right or not. If it is wrong, then the program should tell how off the guess was. If it is right, there should be another positive indicator. You can place a limit on the number of guesses allowed.

You will also need functions to compare the inputted number with the guessed number, to compute the difference between the two, and to check whether an actual number was inputted or not.

The program design is such that it will ask users to enter a series of inputs.The input could be anything, an adjective, a noun, a pronoun, etc. Once all the inputs are entered, the application will take the data and arrange the inputs into a story template form.
